# VR Final

For my VR Final, I decided to make a horror themed walking simulator, with no clear objective. I wanted to set a 'mood' instead of make the player have an objective. I vaguely created a storyline that involved a father and his son being kidnapped. The father wakes up in a forets in the middle of the night and is supposed to find his son, Adam. The player can find some objects that were Adam's, such as his glasses and his teddy bear. There is no grabbing mechanic, all the player has to do is look at the object within a certain distance in order to trigger the Found Item pop up, therefore adding the item to the player's 'inventory' and having the item disappear.

The major problem I had with this final was the grabbing mechanic and finding the right setting for the enviorment. Originally, I was thinking of doing a 'school' type enviorment, but the Asset Store provided no good results for free school 3D models, so I ended up switching to a forest setting. The grabbing mechanic was difficult because there was a hand on the screen, and grabbing with that hand would break immersion and seem awakward, so I had to provide an alternate way to 'grab' objects without using the controller.
